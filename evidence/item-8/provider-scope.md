# Retained-provider scope pass

Status: search index delivered; candidate completeness is NOT VERIFIED.
The index and its keyword-based partition do not prove a complete candidate universe.
Every retained candidate has a row in provider-scope.json.gz, with exact archive
identity and the relevant packaged paths and code-reference candidates. Minecraft
and NeoForge have separate platform rows. Do not count paths or classes as families.

Extractor revision: 21eaef5. Output SHA-256:
b40f85af83a32b53eb20fbced80b914a415e61daf07772a0cf64edb1f68d3fb5.

```sh
uv run -m tools.extract_item8_sources --kind scope --output evidence/raw/item8/provider-scope-21eaef5.json.gz
cmp evidence/item-8/provider-scope.json.gz evidence/raw/item8/provider-scope-21eaef5.json.gz
```

The output reproduces exactly. The three catalogs have pinned hashes and their
archive lists must exactly match retained_sources. The join uses resource_identity
to avoid confusing structure tags with structure definitions. Scoped Ruff and
Basedpyright pass. Initial static findings concerned exception formatting and
string formatting; these were corrected. The pre-correction pilot is preserved
at evidence/raw/item8/provider-scope-pilot.json.gz and is not the accepted output.

The mutually exclusive review lanes partition the 136 retained candidates:

| Review lane | Retained JARs | Required disposition |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Packaged structure definitions | 30 | Reconcile definitions with runtime roots and working families; also inspect additional feature paths. |
| Other generation data or templates | 25 | Assign family, injected component, terrain/vegetation, spawn-only or inactive content. |
| Code references only | 32 | Distinguish generation/injection from library, optimization, commands, client inspection and player construction. |
| No candidates in these searches | 49 | No matched generation data/code. This is a scoped search result, not a semantic absence proof or exemption from loot/mob attribution. |
| Total | 136 | Every retained archive has one row. |

These are provider review counts, not the number of unfinished families or new
implementation tasks. Existing source attribution must be reused. The full exact
names and candidate paths are in the machine-readable file, including nested
archive provenance. A mod can affect family attributes without creating a family.
In particular Loot Integrations appearing in the last lane does not exempt its
loot modifications from Item 8.

Examples requiring semantic reconciliation are listed below. This list is not
a proven exhaustive candidate queue:

1. Feature-based authored-content candidates: BetterEnd building lists and
   crashed ships, Biomes O' Plenty anomaly/monolith/bone spine, Deep Aether totem,
   Explorations scarecrow, and Supplementaries feature/structure aliases.
2. Existing nonregistry families: Quark, YUNG's Bridges, YUNG's Extras and the
   Better End Island platform/gateway contributions. Reuse their decisions;
   close coverage without repeating their detailed source interpretation.
3. Component providers: Farmer's Delight, Chef's Delight, Better Village,
   Village Taverns, Regions Unexplored and RS Farmer's Delight compatibility.
   Bind consuming families; do not add a house or pool as a standalone family.
4. Terrain, vegetation, construction and utility candidates in the remaining
   rows. Use actual resource content and code roles to dispose of them. A
   speculative possibility is not authorization for exhaustive helper tracing.
5. Reconcile family boundaries within the existing 421 provisional groups,
   especially Moog and village designs. Report accepted families and named
   unresolved alternatives separately; do not hide the latter in a vague count.

Do not resume detailed per-family attribute work until this scope queue has an
explicit disposition. The resulting finite family list, not these provider
counts, is the requested answer to how many families remain.

## Reconciliation checkpoint at ac990fd

| Candidate | Delivered result | Remaining scope decision |
| --- | --- | --- |
| BetterEnd building lists | Six live configured-feature IDs and their mixed building/vegetation lists; selector source in 9695ae5. | Assign actual designs and variants; do not call all six lists one family or count every template separately. |
| BetterEnd crashed ship | Registered feature implementation and vanilla ship template reuse in 9695ae5. | Establish active configured/placed use before adding a family. |
| BOP anomaly, monolith, bone spine | Direct writers in 846bc09; both bone-spine definitions reuse one type. | Resolve landmark/terrain boundaries and bind active placement. |
| Deep Aether totem | One stacked design with block/height/facing variations in b0194ce. | Bind registration and placement; preserve one design rather than counting blocks as families. |
| Explorations scarecrow | One figure design, nine material configurations and a selector in ac990fd. | Bind registration and selector/placement relationships; do not count ten configured entries as ten families. |

These captures are delivered and must not be repeated. They narrow the candidate
scope; they are not final per-family attribute acceptance. Supplementaries aliases,
component consumers, remaining utility/terrain dispositions and canonical grouping
within the existing provisional inventory still require reconciliation. Continue
the whole retained-provider reconciliation before returning to attribute implementation.

## Candidate-completeness gate and supported provider dispositions

Priority correction relayed from the user's side conversation: establish
candidate completeness before detailed family attributes or canonical variant
counting. Every retained mod must have supported roles: creates families, injects
components, modifies existing generation, or contributes no structures. Multiple
roles are allowed. Inspect relevant registration/event/mixin entry points and
data. Reconcile registries, features, pool injections, replacements and direct
code generation. Every potentially structural unmatched template, pool and hook
needs a candidate/component link or justified unused/disabled exclusion.

The immediate gate passes only when all 136 retained mods have supported
dispositions and no potentially structural entry points or resources remain
unexplained. Publish all candidates and named ambiguities, keeping generation
eligibility separate from canonical grouping. Zero search hits do not satisfy
this gate. Reuse existing evidence and tools; no new measurement or review system.

The following seven dispositions are supported by complete archive inspection,
not by zero keyword matches. tests/item8/test_loot_addon_provider_scope.py verifies
each frozen archive hash, accounts for every non-directory file, confirms
lowcodefml metadata, and requires all payload files to be loot-integration JSON
with the observed loot-rule fields. There are no classes, nested archives,
services, mixins, scripts, templates or generation resource files in these JARs.

| Retained mod | Supported role | Family-candidate disposition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| lootintegration_townsandtowers-1.3.jar | Loot-rule data for existing containers | No new structure families or generation hooks. |
| lootintegration_wda-1.8.jar | Loot-rule data for existing containers | No new structure families or generation hooks. |
| lootintegrations_ctov-1.4.jar | Loot-rule data for existing containers | No new structure families or generation hooks. |
| lootintegrations_integrated-1.5.jar | Loot-rule data for existing containers | No new structure families or generation hooks. |
| lootintegrations_moog-2.0.jar | Loot-rule data for existing containers | No new structure families or generation hooks. |
| lootintegrations_vanilla-1.6.jar | Loot-rule data for existing containers | No new structure families or generation hooks. |
| lootintegrations_yungs-1.5.jar | Loot-rule data for existing containers | No new structure families or generation hooks. |

Their loot effects remain relevant to existing-family loot-source attribution.
This does not classify the separate lootintegrations-1.21.1-4.7.jar implementation.

```sh
uv run pytest -q tests/item8/test_loot_addon_provider_scope.py
```

Seven focused cases pass. Ruff passes. Basedpyright initially reported untyped
JSON values; a type annotation fixed that finding and the scoped check passes.
Existing captures and decisions for other providers remain evidence to reconcile,
not automatically completed rows. Continue the whole-stack role/resource pass;
do not replace the unresolved remainder with a claim of exhaustive coverage.

## Construction-content provider dispositions

The nine Macaw entry constructors are captured in 007ff06, with exact identities
and reproduction commands in sources/macaw-provider-entries.md. The focused
full-payload check accounts for all files, permits only the observed construction
and painting data categories, checks loader metadata for extra entry mechanisms,
and binds the single annotated Mod entry to its captured class. No additional
auto-subscribers or NeoForge global-bus references appear in these class payloads.
This combines inspected constructor behavior with full archive accounting;
it is not an exclusion based only on generation-keyword absence.

| Retained mod | Supported role | Family-candidate disposition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| mcw-doors-1.1.5-mc1.21.1neoforge.jar | Construction blocks/items, sounds and creative tab | No independent structure family or generation entry point. |
| mcw-lights-1.1.5-mc1.21.1neoforge.jar | Construction blocks/items, sounds and creative tab | No independent structure family or generation entry point. |
| mcw-mcwfences-1.2.1-mc1.21.1neoforge.jar | Construction blocks/items and creative tab | No independent structure family or generation entry point. |
| mcw-mcwpaths-1.1.1-mc1.21.1neoforge.jar | Construction blocks/items and creative tab | No independent structure family or generation entry point. |
| mcw-mcwstairs-1.0.2-mc1.21.1neoforge.jar | Construction blocks/items and creative tab | No independent structure family or generation entry point. |
| mcw-mcwwindows-2.4.2-mc1.21.1neoforge.jar | Construction blocks/items, sounds and creative tab | No independent structure family or generation entry point. |
| mcw-paintings-1.1.0-mc1.21.1neoforge.jar | Painting variants and placeable-painting tag; empty entry constructor | No independent structure family or generation entry point. |
| mcw-roofs-2.3.2-mc1.21.1neoforge.jar | Construction blocks/items and creative tab | No independent structure family or generation entry point. |
| mcw-trapdoors-1.1.5-mc1.21.1neoforge.jar | Construction blocks/items and creative tab | No independent structure family or generation entry point. |

Other providers can use these blocks in their own templates. Such consumption
belongs to those component relationships and is not an independent family added
by the construction mod. This disposition does not claim no effect on block
interaction, salvage or existing loot/recipe data.

```sh
uv run pytest -q tests/item8/test_macaw_provider_scope.py
```

Nine cases pass. Scoped Ruff and Basedpyright pass after correcting an overlong
assertion and splitting a compound assertion. No additional runtime measurement.
Continue supported roles and unexplained-resource reconciliation for the other
retained providers; the whole-stack gate remains open.

## Repurposed Structures Farmer's Delight component provider

`repurposed_structures_farmers_delight_compat_v7.jar` contributes component
injection declarations, piece-count limits and block-rule processor data for
existing Repurposed Structures villages. It contributes no independent root.
The complete archive contains only three metadata files, 13 templates, 12 pool
addition documents, 12 piece-count documents and 11 processor lists. The loader
is lowcodefml; complete file accounting excludes executable code or additional
generation resource mechanisms in this add-on.

The twelve target variants are badlands, bamboo, birch, cherry, dark_forest,
giant_taiga, jungle, mountains, mushroom, oak, ocean and swamp. For each variant
`V`, the component link is:

- Root candidate: `repurposed_structures:village_V`, present in the captured
  live structure registry.
- Pool addition target: `repurposed_structures:villages/V/houses`.
- Component: `farmersdelight:villages/V/houses/compost_pile_1`.

The mushroom target also references `farmersdelight:villages/mushroom/houses/mushroom_farm`.
The sets referenced by pool additions and piece-count declarations each equal
the entire packaged template set. No template is left without a component link.
Ten crop_randomizer processor lists cover the variants other than mushroom and
ocean; the eleventh is mushroom/mushroom_randomizer. All use minecraft:rule.
These are existing-generation modifications, not additional family candidates.

This establishes the add-on's candidate boundary. Actual injection execution,
effective processor precedence and resulting family attributes still belong to
the consuming Repurposed Structures implementation and existing inventory work.
In particular, this does not resolve the already recorded bamboo processor
collision or claim that every component was observed in generated worlds.

The full JSON and template payloads are already preserved in the pinned packaged
catalogs listed above. No new raw capture is required. Reproduce the complete
archive accounting and runtime-root links with:

```sh
uv run pytest -q tests/item8/test_rs_delight_provider_scope.py
```

One case passes. Ruff and Basedpyright pass after explicit string concatenation
and JSON type corrections. This brings the explicit provider dispositions in
this document to 17 of 136. The other 119 require reconciliation into this gate,
including reuse of previously captured and interpreted evidence. This is a
provider-accounting remainder, not an unfinished-family count.
